# Data Analytics Portfolio - Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project

## Project Overview

### Business Challenge

In this Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, I embarked on a mission assigned by the Marketing Director of a Chicago-based bike-share company. The director recognized that the company's future success hinges on maximizing annual memberships. To achieve this, our goal was to gain a deep understanding of the contrasting behaviors of casual riders and annual members when utilizing Cyclistic bikes. Armed with these insights, our objective was to craft a data-driven marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members.

### Role and Responsibilities

As the Junior Data Analyst on the project, my primary responsibility was to dissect how annual members and casual riders interacted with Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Data Handling and Analysis

### Data Sources

I had access to a rich repository of historical data spanning the past 12 months, retrieved from the company's database in CSV format.

### Data Integration

To facilitate comprehensive analysis, I ingested and combined these CSV files using Microsoft SQL Server Studio, resulting in a consolidated dataset encompassing the entire 12-month period.

### Data Pre-processing and Transformation

Utilizing advanced data pre-processing techniques, I meticulously cleaned the data and handled missing values. Employing data manipulation strategies, I effectively transformed the raw data into a structured Destination table.

### Analytics Toolset

My analytical arsenal included:

- Microsoft SQL Server Studio for data integration and manipulation.
- Tableau for creating interactive and insightful data visualizations.

## Deliverables

The crowning achievement of this project was the development of a Tableau Dashboard, fueled by the Destination table. This dashboard is designed to offer actionable insights into the bike usage patterns of casual riders and annual members. It serves as the cornerstone for crafting the company's data-driven marketing strategy.

Explore the Tableau Dashboard to uncover the nuanced behaviors of our customer segments, steering us towards effective marketing tactics and increased annual memberships.
